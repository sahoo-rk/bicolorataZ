Genome assembly and annotation pipeline

Here I am outlining the assembly and annotation pipeline of *Zygogramma bicolorata*, also known as the Mexican beetle. As an ecologist by training, this excercise of has 
been a steep learning curve for me, but at the same time, it has been one of the most engaging part of my current research as I make myself capable of thinking towards
the constellation that resides within a genome, every genome.

Hope this pipeline will be an useful asset to the reader, particulary to the researchers from non-bioinformatics background.
Wish the best!
