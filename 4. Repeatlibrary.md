Identification and annotation of repeats in the draft genome

As an essential step prior to the de-novo genome annotation, we identified and annotated different classes of repeats in the draft genome. The process of repeat annotation
is a never ending task. However, to prepare a comprehensive repeat landscape of the draft genome, we adopted recently benchmarked pipelines that brings a brilliant compilation
of analytical tools and publicly available databases under a common umbrella.

We used **The Extensive *de novo* TE Annotator** [EDTA](https://github.com/oushujun/EDTA).
```bash
# Running EDTA
EDTA.pl --genome $assembly --overwrite 1 --sensitive 1 --anno 1 --evaluate 1 --threads 110
```
