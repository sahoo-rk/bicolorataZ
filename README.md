Genome assembly and annotation pipeline

> This repository has two primary agenda: one, a supplementary material to our research publication XXX on the beetle genome assembly; two, a guide to the non-bioinformaticians to get acquainted to the genome assembly pipeline.

Here I am outlining the assembly and annotation pipeline of *Zygogramma bicolorata*, also known as the Mexican beetle. As an ecologist by training, I have had to follow a very steep learning curve when I started working with the high-throughput sequence data, particularly because of the extent of bioinformatics involved. However, I am happy to realise that this period has been one of the most engaging part of my current research as I learn and apply the bioinformatic fundamentals and tools to explore and understand the unknown. 

Hope this pipeline will be an useful asset to the readers, particulary to the researchers from non-bioinformatics background.  
Wish the best!
