# bicolorataZ
Genome assembly and annotation pipeline of *Zygogramma bicolorata*, commonly known as the Mexican beetle.

> This repository has two primary agenda: one, a supplementary material to our research publication XXX on the beetle genome assembly; two, a guide to the non-bioinformaticians to get acquainted to the genome assembly pipeline.

As an ecologist by training, I have had a very steep learning curve while working with the high-throughput sequence data. However, I realise that this period has been one of the most engaging part of my current research as I learn and apply the bioinformatic fundamentals and tools to explore and understand the unknown.

Few key notations need to be clarified to make sure that all the syntax used in the pipeline are clear and crystal.  
```~/path/to/dir``` denotes path to the directory of interest.  
```~/path/to/dir/in``` denotes path to the directory where the input file resides.  
```~/path/to/dir/out``` denotes path to the directory where the output file will be placed.  
```./``` indicates current directory from where the program of interest in executing.  

Hope this pipeline will be an useful asset to the readers, particulary to the researchers from non-bioinformatics background.  
Wish the best!
